# YouTube Frame

Sometimes I want a YouTube video in a small window
on my screen, but with YouTube you only can do
full screen or skrink the window along with the
comments, suggested videos, and whatever else, and
try to hand nudge the video into place. That sucks
so here is this.

There are Chrome extensions for this, but I thought
a small web tool is worth a shot too for cross-browser
support plus a bookmarklet can send people here.
